Telegram Bot Using OpenAI API

This is a Telegram bot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user prompts.

Prerequisites
Node.js v12 or higher
A Telegram bot token
An OpenAI API key

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-bot.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd telegram-bot

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Create a .env file in the project directory and set the following environment variables:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY APP_URL=https://my-server.herokuapp.com
Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual bot token and API key, and https://my-server.herokuapp.com with the URL of your server.

Deployment:
Deploy the code to a server that is accessible from the internet (e.g. using a service like Heroku).
Set the APP_URL environment variable to the URL of your server (e.g. https://my-server.herokuapp.com).

Set the webhook on Telegram by sending a POST request to the setWebhook API endpoint with the following URL:
https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook?url=https://my-server.herokuapp.com/webhook

Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token and https://my-server.herokuapp.com with the URL of your server. You can send this request using a tool like Postman or by running the following curl command:
curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook?url=https://my-server.herokuapp.com/webhook

Start the server:
 
npm run start
The bot will now be listening for updates from the Telegram API and responding to user messages.

Development
To start the server in development mode, run the following
npm run dev

This will start the server and run the bot in development mode, using nodemon to automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.
Usage

To interact with the bot, send a message starting with /chat followed by your prompt. The bot will generate a response to the prompt using the ChatGPT 3.5 language model.
For example, you can send the following message to the bot:
/chat What is the weather like today?
The bot will respond with a generated message, such as:
It looks like it will be mostly cloudy today with a chance of rain.
